# ArduinoBLEThermometer
Creating the Arduino BLE Thermometer based on this repository will require the following hardware:
* An Arduino/Genuino 101 microcontroller board
* A TMP36 temperature sensor module
* A breadboard
* Three (3) wires

The included Xcode project has been written in Swift 4, developed for an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 11.

I am not providing any support for this software other than releasing it for you to do with as you please :-)
