# ArduinoBLEThermometer
## Important Note:
The original version of this repository utilized the TMP36 temperature sensor, but the current version uses the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.

Creating the Arduino BLE Thermometer based on this repository will require the following hardware:
* An Arduino/Genuino 101 microcontroller board
* A DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor module
* A breadboard
* Three (3) wires

The included Xcode project has been written in Swift 4, developed for an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 11.

I am not providing any support for this software other than releasing it for you to do with as you please :-)
